## Overview
`app.exe` is a lightweight executable that ensures all necessary dependencies are installed before running the main application. The first time you run `app.exe`, it may take a little longer as it sets up a virtual environment and installs dependencies. Subsequent runs will be faster.

## Requirements
- **Python** must be installed on your system.

## How to Run
1. **Download or clone** the repository.
2. **Double-click** `app.exe` to start the application.

## Notes
- Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the root directory.
- If Python is not installed, please install it before running `app.exe`.

## Troubleshooting
- If `app.exe` does not start, try running it from the command line to check for any error messages.
- Ensure Python is added to your system's PATH.

Enjoy!
